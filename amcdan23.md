My name is Adam McDaniel and I am a freshman computer science major.
I'm extremely interested in compiler and interpreter design, and have written several projects such as [Oak](https://github.com/adam-mcdaniel/oakc)
[(blog post)](https://esoteric.codes/blog/oak), which experiment in these areas.
I'm looking forward to learning more about how to contribute to other existing projects, and how to work with other people on my projects.

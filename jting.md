My name is Jonathan Ting and I'm a Senior in Computer Engineering. I'm currently working an undergrad research position under Dr. Rose, working with FPGAs and hardware security. I do most of my coding with C and C++, however I have experience with C# and Python too. I've also done some web development and the Django framework on the side as the Secretary of the UTK Model UN club and for fun. I enjoy making random webtools from shower thoughts I have, such as a tool that sorts Spotify playlists using merge sort. As for interests, I enjoy games, sports (hockey), anime, and also playing Fantasy Football (I've done some fun coding projects in the past for that, such as making visual graphs for RB yardage, Jon Bois-style).  I also have a decent amount of experience with Git, but not with large open source projects.

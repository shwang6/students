My name is Jacob Leonard and I am studying Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity. I'm interested in a lot of fields and am in the midst of exploring my options, but I enjoy the topics of cybersecurity and web development the most. I'm excited to collaborate with students and learn more about open-source projects.
